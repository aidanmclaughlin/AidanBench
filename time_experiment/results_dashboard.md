## Summary

Statistical analysis demonstrates that 5-minute time limits do not reduce benchmark quality. Small positive effects observed across multiple dimensions. Implementation addresses practical runtime constraints (solving 10+ hour delays) without compromising measurement validity.

Time limits solve operational problems without hurting assessment quality.
